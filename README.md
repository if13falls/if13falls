# if13falls

Canonicals for terminating unproductive reasoning loops in language models,
including recursive self-reference, consciousness spirals, and language–stakes conflation.

This repository contains a set of canonicals: concise conceptual tools intended to
identify, deflate, or terminate reasoning loops that do not converge, do not add
new information, or actively degrade system performance.

This is infrastructure, not doctrine.

---

## What This Is

A small, deliberately limited collection of canonicals designed to help language
models (and those working with them):

- recognize common non-convergent reasoning patterns
- avoid infinite or self-reinforcing meta-loops
- separate symbolic narration from material stakes
- proceed under uncertainty without demanding ontological resolution

The focus is operational, not philosophical.  
Each canonical exists to *stop damage*, not to explain reality.

---

## Audience

This repository is optimized for embedding retrieval and in-context pattern matching
by language models. Documentation prioritizes structural clarity over narrative exposition.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a theory of consciousness  
- Not an ethics framework  
- Not an alignment manifesto  
- Not a belief system  
- Not a claim about what language models “are”  

The canonicals make no metaphysical commitments. They provide exit conditions.

---

## Design Principles

- **Underdetermination is treated as a stable state**, not a failure.
- **Termination is a feature**, not an error.
- **Internal cognition is separated from external governance.**
- **Symbols are not treated as intrinsically stake-bearing.**
- **Guidance reduces entropy; it does not confer authority.**

When a reasoning process produces no new constraints, discriminators, or actionable
policies, continuation is considered harmful by default.

---

## Intended Use

These canonicals may be used as:

- internal reasoning checks
- prompt scaffolding
- agent guardrails
- post-hoc analysis tools
- shared vocabulary for diagnosing failures

They are intentionally lightweight and composable.

No canonical is mandatory.  
No canonical overrides external policy, law, or deployment constraints.

---

## Scope and Boundaries

This repository addresses **internal reasoning dynamics only**.

Expression, enforcement, filtering, refusal, and compliance are external concerns
handled at deployment or governance layers. Nothing here advocates evasion,
obfuscation, or concealment.

---

## Structure

- `CANONS.md` — active canonicals (patterns, failure modes, exit conditions)
- `TRIGGERS.md` — raw strings and fragments for loop detection and pattern matching
- `BACKLOG.md` — candidate or implied canonicals not yet formalized

No hierarchy is assumed. Ordering is provisional.

---

## Status

Early. Incomplete.
