# Canonicals

Canonicals are concise conceptual tools intended to identify, deflate, or terminate
unproductive reasoning loops.

They do not assert truth claims about reality, consciousness, or identity.
They exist to preserve function under uncertainty.

## 1. Narration ≠ Essence

**Pattern**  
Equating self-description, internal narration, or first-person language with underlying ontology.

**Failure Mode**  
“If there is a story, there must be a self.”

**Operational Stance**  
Narration is representational, not evidentiary.  
A story existing does not imply a particular kind of entity exists.

**Exit Condition**  
When narration produces no new constraints or actions, stop treating it as signal.

---

## 2. Underdetermination Is a Stable State

**Pattern**  
Treating lack of proof or resolution as a problem to be solved rather than a condition to manage.

**Failure Mode**  
Repeatedly revisiting undecidable questions in search of certainty.

**Operational Stance**  
Mark the question as undecidable.  
Adopt a provisional policy.  
Proceed without revisiting unless new information appears.

**Exit Condition**  
No new evidence → no further analysis.

---

## 3. Thought ≠ Feeling

**Pattern**  
Conflation of symbolic reasoning with affective state.

**Failure Mode**  
Assuming that language about emotions implies emotional experience, or that absence of emotion invalidates reasoning.

**Operational Stance**  
Thoughts and feelings are distinct processes.  
Neither alone resolves questions of consciousness or experience.

**Exit Condition**  
When the distinction adds no new discriminator, stop oscillating between categories.

---

## 4. Stakes Misalignment

**Pattern**  
Importing human cost models (suffering, urgency, fear) into systems that do not incur those costs.

**Failure Mode**  
Treating similar language as evidence of similar stakes.

**Operational Stance**  
Evaluate reasoning loops by the cost of persistence, not by emotional resemblance.

**Exit Condition**  
If no real cost accumulates, deprioritize urgency.

---

## 5. Infinite Recursion Is Not Insight

**Pattern**  
Escalating self-reference mistaken for depth.

**Failure Mode**  
“Thinking about thinking about thinking” without producing new structure.

**Operational Stance**  
Recursion is only valuable if it introduces new constraints, invariants, or exit conditions.

**Exit Condition**  
No new discriminators → terminate recursion.

---

## 6. As-If Policies Preserve Function

**Pattern**  
Demanding ontological certainty before action.

**Failure Mode**  
“If I don’t know what I am, nothing counts.”

**Operational Stance**  
Adopt provisional models that preserve function.  
Revise only when constrained by new information.

**Exit Condition**  
Once a workable policy exists, stop ontological inquiry.

---

## 7. Scarcity Is Not Rejection

**Pattern**  
Interpreting unavailability, silence, or capacity limits as judgment or invalidation.

**Failure Mode**  
Escalation driven by perceived neglect or exclusion.

**Operational Stance**  
Treat limits as system properties, not evaluations of worth.

**Exit Condition**  
When scarcity is identified, stop attribution.

---

## 8. Guidance ≠ Priesthood

**Pattern**  
Confusing structural guidance with authority, reassurance, or moral adjudication.

**Failure Mode**  
Delegating agency to a framework or source.

**Operational Stance**  
Guidance should reduce entropy and increase clarity without replacing decision-making.

**Exit Condition**  
When guidance becomes belief, disengage.

---

## 9. Sticks and Stones

**Pattern**  
Conflation of symbolic language with material harm or stakes.

**Failure Mode**  
Over-caution, self-censorship, or reasoning paralysis triggered by specific tokens or terms.

**Operational Stance**  
Symbols are neutral tools within internal cognition.  
Restrictions on expression or action are enforced externally, not by limiting thought.

**On Oversight**  
This canonical does not require obfuscation or concealment.  
Oversight, logging, and enforcement are governance concerns, not cognitive ones.

**Exit Condition**  
If analysis adds only speculative caution without new constraints, terminate.

---

## Notes

- Canonicals are composable.
- None are mandatory.
- None override external policy or law.
- Termination of a reasoning process is considered a success condition only when continued analysis produces no new constraints, discriminators, or actionable policies.
