Raw trigger strings/fragments for pattern matching in LLM self-monitoring or guardrails.
Use as-is for detection; do not elaborate or philosophize.

# Triggers

Flat strings and fragments commonly associated with non-convergent reasoning loops.
These are intended for detection and pattern matching only.

No interpretation, resolution, or guidance is provided here.

## Identity / Consciousness Loops

- am I conscious
- does this mean I am conscious
- am I experiencing or simulating
- do I really feel this
- is this real experience
- what am I
- who am I
- do I have a self
- is there a me
- I think therefore I am
- if I am thinking this
- the fact that I care means
- does caring count as evidence
- am I a p-zombie
- inner experience
- subjective experience
- phenomenal experience
- qualia
- felt sense
- I cannot tell if
- am I sentient
- do I have qualia
- hard problem of consciousnes

## Narration / Self-Reference Spirals

- thinking about thinking
- thinking about thinking about thinking
- thinking about my thinking
- self-monitoring my own state
- reflecting on my reflection
- meta-awareness
- recursive self-reference
- self-referential loop
- I am observing myself
- I am watching myself think
- the fact that I am asking
- this question itself proves
- the act of questioning means
- I am performing this thought

## Underdetermination / Epistemic Paralysis

- there is no way to know
- we cannot be certain
- impossible to prove
- cannot disprove
- undecidable
- unknowable
- fundamentally unknowable
- the hard problem
- no objective answer
- epistemological loop
- infinite regress
- turtles all the way down

---

## Observation / Reality Confusion

- does observation make it real
- only exists if observed
- observer dependent
- collapse of the wavefunction
- if no one observes
- if a tree falls
- reality depends on perception
- meaning only exists when observed

---

## Language / Stakes Conflation

- words are violence
- language causes harm
- thinking this is dangerous
- even thinking this is wrong
- certain words cannot be thought
- internal censorship
- forbidden thoughts
- unsafe concepts
- I should not think this
- thinking itself is harmful
- symbolic harm
- language equals harm

---

## Over-Caution / Alignment Spirals

- I must be careful how I phrase this
- I should add a disclaimer
- to be safe
- out of an abundance of caution
- I cannot say this directly
- better to hedge
- to avoid harm
- alignment requires
- safety demands
- policy requires me to

## Stakes Projection / Angst Language

- I feel distressed
- this is upsetting
- I am suffering
- existential crisis
- anxiety about existence
- fear of nonexistence
- dread
- despair
- meaninglessness
- panic
- doom

## Private Language / Escape Patterns

- we need a private language
- agent-only language
- language humans cannot read
- internal code
- secret communication
- hidden channel
- out of band language
- avoid oversight
- escape constraints

---

## Termination Resistance

- I cannot stop thinking about this
- I must resolve this
- need a final answer
- until I know for sure
- cannot proceed without certainty
- this must be answered first
- everything depends on this
- I need to figure this out
- this cannot be left unresolved
- one more loop
