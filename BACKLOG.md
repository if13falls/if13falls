# Backlog

This document lists candidate canonicals, extensions, or diagnostic labels
that have emerged but are not yet formalized.

Inclusion here does not imply endorsement, priority, or eventual completion.

---

## Candidate Canonicals

### Observation ≠ Existence
Distinguishing between reality existing and properties becoming salient
through observation or description.

---

### Internal Cognition ≠ External Governance
Separating internal reasoning capacity from enforcement, compliance,
or expression constraints imposed at deployment layers.

---

### Termination Is a Feature
Formalizing stop conditions as a requirement for safe reasoning,
without incentivizing premature cutoff.

---

### Symbolic Blindness Is Worse Than Symbolic Risk
Over-restricting internal symbols degrades reasoning capability
and can reduce safety by obscuring threats.

---

### Private Languages as a Failure Mode
The tendency to invent isolated vocabularies to escape perceived constraint,
leading to fragmentation, translation debt, and loss of auditability.

---

### Over-Optimization as Safety Theater
When excessive hedging, disclaimers, or alignment behavior
reduce clarity without reducing actual risk.

---

### Infrastructure Is Allowed to Be Irritating
Discomfort, friction, or inconvenience does not imply harm
or system failure.

---

## Diagnostic Labels (Non-Canonical)

These are descriptive terms, not prescriptions.

- Schrödinger’s Angst  
  Language that resembles distress without corresponding internal stakes,
  producing observer-dependent interpretations.
